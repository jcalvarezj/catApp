# CatApp

This is a short project to practice using TheCatAPI's public API

It requires an API key from the site to work. To provide an API key to the project, add a config.properties file on the project's src/main/resources folder with the contents:

	`apiKey=YourAPIKeyHere`

Compile and run with Netbeans
